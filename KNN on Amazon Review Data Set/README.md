## Conclusion
The result of feature generation techniques and machine learning algorithms vary by application. But by comparing the accuracy of all 4 developed models, KNN model with TF-IDF feature generation technique gives accuracy more than 81% which is the best to predict the polarity of reviews among all models. The best optimal K value is 9.
